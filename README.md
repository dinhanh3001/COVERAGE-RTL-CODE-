Firstly, what is the corner test, random test with constraint and coverage-rtl code ? 
- Corner test is a directed test, engineers wil predit the case that can be wrong and conduct a test in these situation.
- Random test with constraint is a way to divided in some groups test case that have a common behaviorals.
- Coverage code is a way to evaluate the coverage of your test bench. It's mean, it caculate how many percent that your test case passed
  It includes 5 basic level: Line coverage( how many line executed ?), Branch/Decision coverage ( Do it pass all of the case command or if-else command ?)
  Condition coverage, Toggle coverage (how many percent nets,regs in the design passed 0-> 1 and 1->0),
  FSM coverage.
